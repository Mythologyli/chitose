# chitose

An iftop alternative for cumulated network traffic monitoring, for OSS mirror admins.

**Outbound traffic by default**.

## Build

```bash
go build
```

This uses gopacket and thus NOT supporting `CGO_ENABLED=0` for static linking.
You need to install libpcap to use this.

Note that binaries in Releases are compiled under Ubuntu 20.04 (glibc 2.31).

## Usage

```console
> ./chitose -h
Usage of ./chitose:
  -i string
        Interface to listen on (default "eth0")
  -inbound
        Show inbound traffic instead of outbound
  -no-netstat
        Do not detect active connections
  -sort-delta
        Sort by delta instead of total
  -top int
        Number of top values to show (default 10)
  -ipdb string
        IPDB format database file (default "" for no IPDB)

Press 's' (lowercase) to change sort order
```

You might need root privilege to run this program.

## Alternative

[iBug's ctmon](https://github.com/iBug/goGadgets/tree/master/ctmon) uses conntrack instead of pcap to monitor, which is a more lightweight solution.

## Naming

Same as the nginx log analyzer [ayano](https://github.com/taoky/ayano),
and chitose shares some code with that :)
